In this project, there were some mistakes made, and the operations were conducted using Oracle Apex. While contributing to every aspect of the assignment, my specific responsibilities included working on the Order and Customer tables, constructing scenarios for queries 1, 2, 3, and 4, as well as creating a view (excluding the staff_customer_view) and implementing indexes.
